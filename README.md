# Installation
1 - Unzip the "VoimaWindowsTheme-main.zip" archive to the "C:\" drive (NOTE! THE Cursors AND Sounds FOLDERS MUST BE IN THE "C:\VoimaWindowsTheme-main" FOLDER)  

2 - Place the "Voima.theme" file in the "C:\Windows\Resources\Themes" folder  

3 - Go to "Settings - Personalization - Themes" and select "Voima"  

4 - Enjoy! :D  



# Addendum
- If you don't like the default wallpaper, you can choose other wallpapers in the "wallpapers" folder (you can also put a [video wallpaper](https://www.google.com "Сайт Google"), but for that you need additional software like Wallpaper Engine).
  
- You can change the Hilight color to light green with the "HilightColor.reg" file. (Reboot required!)

- If you want to get 100% similarity:
  - “Settings - Personalization - Colors” and click the “Window Titles and Window Borders” check box
  - “Settings - Devices - Mouse - Mouse - Advanced Mouse Settings - Cursor” and click the “Cursor Shadow” checkbox.
